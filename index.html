Hey taryn, I am sure you caught on a bit to what I was doing by trying to make a website. 
But I wanted to try to surprise you as best I could with this. You mean so much to me that there could not have 
been a better introduction to learning this than doing something for you.

Happy 2 years Taryn!<br><br>

	Thank you so much for the 2 years of goofy growth we 
 have had so far. Despite my flaws and wounds that are rather 
 hostile to a healthy relationship, I appreciate you so much for your 
 love and perserverance. I really do look forward to spending the 
 rest of our lives together as long as the Lord will allows that 
 we may. <br> <br> 
Sincerly and goofily, <br>
Micah, Moo, Moocah, McJeffy
